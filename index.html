    <h1>That is my CV</h1>
        <p>My name is Oleg Tumandeev</p>
   		<p>My phone number: 89377980602 <br>My email: greenpeesoleg@gmail.com</p>
   		<p>Hello! My goal is to become a junior developer and learn new things in this. I am a 4th year student at the Samara University. I set goals and achieve them, and I am also going to support myself in what I love. I still have no work experience, but I'm going to fix it in the near future. </p>
        <p>I am good at computers, in the work of web technologies. I have little experience in programming the server side in python, the client side in vanilla javascript. Prior to that, I studied the simple and average algorithms in C and C ++.</p>
        <p>I have no experience in this, only a little practice on the web on Java. My works will be on the link: <a href="http://example.com/">Not available now</a></p>
        <p>I am finishing my fourth year at Samara University. I study at the Faculty of Computer Science, a specialty related to information security, so I study things close to the hardware part.</p>
        I can rate my English level at B1. I only practice by watching videos and reading material in English.
    <h2>Thank you for reading my CV!</h2>
