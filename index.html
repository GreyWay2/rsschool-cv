      <p>Hello! My goal is to become a junior developer and learn new things in this. I am a 4th year student at the Samara University. <br>I set goals and achieve them, and I am also going to support myself in what I love. I still have no work experience, but I'm going to fix it in the near future. </p>
      <p>I am good at computers, in the work of web technologies.<br> I can rate my skills as:</p>

      <p>I have no experience in this, only a little practice on the web on Java. My works will be on the link: <a href="https://github.com/GreyWay2">My github</a></p>
      <p>I am finishing my fourth year at Samara University. I study at the Faculty of Computer Science, a specialty related to information security, so I study things close to the hardware part.</p>
